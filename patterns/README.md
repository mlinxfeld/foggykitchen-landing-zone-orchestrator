# Patterns

This directory contains the **shared HCL orchestration patterns** used by FoggyKitchen Landing Zone Orchestrator.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Patterns are the reusable implementation layer of the repository.

They are responsible for:

- normalizing YAML payload input
- resolving logical references
- composing FoggyKitchen modules
- exposing a stable pattern interface to examples

Examples under `examples/` should stay thin and delegate architecture logic to the shared patterns in this directory.

## 🧭 How To Read This Directory

Recommended order:

1. start with [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md)
2. review [docs/payload-contract.md](../docs/payload-contract.md)
3. inspect the relevant pattern directory
4. compare it with one of the thin example wrappers under `examples/`

- `azure/private_endpoint` extends the shared Azure networking foundation
- advanced multicloud implementations are intentionally distributed outside this public repository
