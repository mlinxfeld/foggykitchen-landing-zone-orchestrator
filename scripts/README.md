# Scripts

This directory is reserved for **helper scripts, validation helpers, and payload tooling** that may be introduced in later phases of the repository.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this directory is to keep auxiliary automation separate from the shared Terraform / OpenTofu patterns.

Typical future use cases:

- payload validation helpers
- diagram generation helpers
- wrapper utilities for staged deployments
- light documentation tooling

At the current stage, runtime logic stays mostly inside the shared patterns and example-local assets such as `cloud-init` scripts.
